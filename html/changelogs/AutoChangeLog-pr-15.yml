changes:
  - bugfix: removed natural wig from loadout, was making it impossible to select the
      colorable one. if you want a natural wig use the bald quirk
  - tweak: maid dress in the uniforms section is back to just being the uniform. the
      other pieces of the maid outfit are available on their own in their respective
      pieces of the loadout, or in the general section you can get the box
